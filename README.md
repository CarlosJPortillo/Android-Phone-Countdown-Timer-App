# Android-Phone-Countdown-Timer-App
An android app that is essentially a timer app. A current work in progress as I start delving more into Android phone development for self growth. More features to come. Currently give the user the option to enter minutes up to 60 minutes, which is an hour. Though this will change. Input validation accounted for. There is a pause button and reset button. Due to the nature of Android phone development(specifically Android Studio Java enviorment) requiring a lot of files to run(well over a 100), I'm only uploading the few important files that I make changes to, that give the phone it's appearance and core functionality.  In this instance, the layout activity XML file, and main activity Java file. This will probably be the case for any and all future apps I decide to upload made through Android Studio.
