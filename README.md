# Android-Phone-Countdown-Timer-App
An android app that is essentially a timer app. A current work in progress as I start delving more into Android phone development for self growth. More features to come, currently has a starting default time value of 10 minutes, but eventually will give the user the option to set time and other features. Due to the nature of Android phone development(specifically Android Studio Java enviorment) requiring a lot of files to run(well over a 100), I'm only uploading the few important files that I make changes to, that give the phone it's appearance and core functionality.  In this instance, the layout activity XML file, and main activity Java file.
